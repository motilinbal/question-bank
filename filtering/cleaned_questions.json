    "explanation": "OPTION a is Incorrect . Splitting of the glomerular basement membrane (tram track appearance) on electron microscopy is seen in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis . Although this condition is associated with nephrotic syndrome , which this patient likely has, the disease would not explain her neurologic findings and elevated hemoglobin A 1c . Splitting of the glomerular basement membrane can also be seen in individuals with Alport syndrome , but this condition manifests with hematuria in males during infancy . OPTION b is Incorrect . Immune complex deposition with a “spike-and-dome” appearance on electron microscopy is a characteristic finding in patients with membranous nephropathy , the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults. Deposition of antibodies between podocytes and the basal membrane causes thickening of glomerular capillary loops and the basal membrane, which in turn leads to nephrotic syndrome . However, the disease would not explain this patient's neurologic findings and elevated hemoglobin A 1c . OPTION c is Incorrect . Interstitial inflammation is a common finding in allergic interstitial nephritis , a type of nephropathy that is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs such as antibiotics , NSAIDs , and diuretics . Patients with this disorder typically present with eosinophiluria , gross hematuria , flank pain , and a diffuse maculopapular rash , none of which are present here. OPTION d is Incorrect . Capillary wire looping, which is associated with diffuse subendothelial glomerular deposits, is a typical electron microscopic finding in diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis ( DPGN ). DPGN can manifest with elevated serum creatinine and nephrotic syndrome , as seen in this patient, but it most commonly occurs in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus and typically manifests with gross hematuria . OPTION e is Correct . Nodular glomerulosclerosis with Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules is pathognomonic for diabetic nephropathy , although diffuse glomerulosclerosis is the most common finding. In patients with insufficiently controlled diabetes mellitus , chronic hyperglycemia results in non-enzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins . This leads to increased synthesis and decreased degeneration of the mesangial matrix within renal glomeruli , which causes mesangial expansion. Thickening and increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane causes hyperfiltration, which leads to glomerular hypertrophy and scarring."

    "explanation": "OPTION a is Incorrect . S cell hyperplasia would lead to an increased secretion of secretin , which normally increases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and decreases gastric acid secretion by physiologically inhibiting gastrin secretion from G cells . Increased secretin would not cause anemia , inflammation of the gastric body and fundus, elevated gastrin production, or G-cell hyperplasia . OPTION b is Incorrect . Mucosal cell hyperplasia would lead to an increased secretion of bicarbonate , which increases gastric pH . While hypochlorhydria can result in microcytic anemia (due to decreased absorption of iron ), mucosal cell hyperplasia would not explain the inflammation of the gastric body and fundus, an elevated gastrin production, or G-cell hyperplasia seen in this patient. OPTION c is Incorrect . Enterochromaffin-like cell ( ECL ) hyperplasia would increase the secretion of histamine and subsequently gastric acid production, which can lead to inflammation of the gastric body and fundus. Gastrin stimulates histamine release from ECL cells but would not occur as a consequence of ECL hyperplasia . The combination of anemia , hypergastrinemia , and G-cell hyperplasia are more likely due to an alternate etiology. OPTION d is Correct . Parietal cell destruction in the gastric fundus is seen in autoimmune-mediated atrophic gastritis ( AMAG ), which results in reduced gastric acid production. The reduced acid production in AMAG leads to loss of negative feedback on G cells , which subsequently causes G cell hyperplasia in the gastric antrum and hypergastrinemia . Parietal cell destruction also impairs intrinsic factor production and causes decreased vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum , leading to vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia ( pernicious anemia ). However, iron deficiency anemia may be present earlier in the disease course, due to the decreased solubility of iron in the setting of hypochlorhydria. OPTION e is Incorrect . Chief cell destruction is seen in chronic gastritis with mucosal atrophy and would lead to impaired protein digestion due to decreased production of pepsinogen (which is converted to pepsin ). Since pepsin cleaves vitamin B 12 from food proteins , a pepsin deficiency can impair the absorption of protein-bound vitamin B 12 , which would manifest with macrocytic anemia . However, chief cell destruction would not affect gastrin production or cause the G-cell hyperplasia seen here. OPTION f is Incorrect . I cell destruction would lead to a decreased secretion of cholecystokinin , which normally increases pancreatic secretion, mediates gallbladder contraction, and inhibits gastric emptying. Decreased secretion of cholecystokinin would not explain the anemia , inflammation of the gastric body and fundus, elevated gastrin production, or G-cell hyperplasia seen in this patient."

    "explanation": "OPTION a is Correct . Decreased compliance of the left ventricle is most likely due to left ventricular hypertrophy caused by long-standing hypertension and often manifests with an S 4 gallop . Increased blood pressure activates angiotensin II either by local mechanical stretching of myocardiocytes or as a result of the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Angiotensin II promotes concentric remodeling of the heart , increasing stiffness of the organ, thus, decreasing compliance . OPTION b is Incorrect . Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve occurs in some connective tissue diseases (e.g., Marfan syndrome , Ehler-Danlos syndrome ) leading to eventual mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ). MVP is associated with late- systolic crescendo murmurs as blood backflows from the left ventricle to the left atrium , followed by a midsystolic click due to tensing of the chordae tendinae . The mitral regurgitation and volume overload associated with MVP can also result in an S3 , which is an early diastolic sound, but MVP is not typically associated with an S4 , as seen here. OPTION c is Incorrect . Pericardial inflammation ( pericarditis ), which is typically caused by viral infections, would result in an auscultatory finding ( pericardial friction rub ) but this sound would be heard in both diastolic and systolic portions of the cardiac cycle and it would be best heard along the left sternal border when the patient sits upright, leans forward, and holds his breath. The sound that is heard here is an S4 gallop , which is an unusual finding in pericarditis . Moreover, patients with pericarditis are rarely asymptomatic; they would usually complain of chest pain and/or breathlessness. It is, therefore, unlikely that this patient has pericarditis . OPTION d is Incorrect . Dilation of the aortic root, which is caused by age-related degenerative changes, hypertension , aortitis (e.g., tertiary syphilis ), or connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan syndrome ), causes chronic aortic insufficiency ( AI ). AI can result in a low-pitched , mid or late diastolic sound that is best heard at the cardiac apex due to vibration of the ventricular wall by the regurgitant jet. However, a patient with AI would also have an early diastolic murmur best heard in the right upper sternal border. An isolated low-pitched , late diastolic sound on cardiac examination suggests another cause. OPTION e is Incorrect . Thickening of the mitral leaflet is seen in mitral stenosis and is the cause of the opening snap , which is an early diastolic sound that is best heard at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position . However, the opening snap is a high-pitched sound, unlike the low-pitched sound heard here, and it would be accompanied by the late- diastolic , decrescendo murmur of mitral stenosis ."

Furthermore, GBS typically appears after a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection and would not show plaques on MRI imaging. OPTION d is Incorrect .

Additionally, it would be unusual for the disease to manifest in a patient who is so young (typical age of onset is > 65 years ). OPTION e is Correct . Acute multiple sclerosis plaques are characterized by demyelination with partial preservation of axons , along with infiltration of immune cells , accumulation of macrophages with phagocytized myelin , and parenchymal edema . These changes are a result of an autoimmune reaction in which mainly T helper cells are activated against CNS antigens . This reaction can be triggered by environmental factors such as infection with EBV or HHV 6 , UV radiation , insufficient vitamin D consumption, and/or cigarette smoking . The subsequent inflammatory process leads to focal demyelination with nerve destruction, gliosis , and inadequate remyelination, which, in turn, results in impaired saltatory conduction of action potentials ."

    "explanation": "OPTION a is Incorrect . This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril ), which inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II , resulting in low levels of angiotensin II . Angiotensin II mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, vasoconstriction , and aldosterone release. Decreased activation of angiotensin II receptors would, therefore, lead to an increase in urinary sodium excretion, decreased vessel tone, and lower levels of aldosterone . The combination of these effects lowers blood pressure. Treatment with ACE inhibitors would typically lead to an increase in renin levels and renin activity due to a loss of negative feedback regulation. OPTION b is Incorrect . This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with beta-1 blockers (e.g., metoprolol ). Beta-1 blockers inhibit the production and release of renin , which leads to suppression of the downstream renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) components (i.e., angiotensin II and aldosterone ) and, subsequently, mildly decreased vessel tone and increased urinary sodium excretion. OPTION c is Incorrect . This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with diuretics , which increase urine sodium elimination and cause a transient increase in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) activity and peripheral vascular tone. Over time, the activity of the RAAS system and peripheral vascular tone will decrease. OPTION d is Incorrect . This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with vasodilators such as hydralazine and alpha-1 blockers (e.g., doxazosin ), which directly decrease peripheral vessel tone, resulting in lower blood pressure. Increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system would occur as a compensatory response to maintain GFR resulting in increased renin , angiotensin II , and aldosterone levels as well as decreased urinary sodium excretion. OPTION e is Correct . Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan , valsartan , candesartan ) inhibit angiotensin II receptors ( AT 1 receptors ). Angiotensin II mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, vasoconstriction , and aldosterone release. Blocking of angiotensin II receptors, therefore, leads to an increase in urinary sodium excretion, decreased peripheral vascular resistance , and lower levels of aldosterone . The combination of these effects lowers blood pressure. To compensate for decreased sodium and water reabsorption, the juxtaglomerular apparatus will release more renin , which will subsequently increase the levels of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II . Meanwhile, bradykinin levels are not affected, as ARBs have no effect on ACE , which metabolizes bradykinin . Therefore, ARBs do not cause a dry cough as a side effect."

Weeks to months later, invasion of the central nervous system may lead to confusion, coordination problems, and sleeping disorders (neurological phase), none of which are seen in this patient. OPTION b is Incorrect . Trichinella spiralis can be transmitted by ingestion of larvae in undercooked pork meat, causing trichinellosis . After ingestion of contaminated meat, cysts release larvae in the stomach , causing gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain , bloating , and diarrhea (enteral phase). Adult worms then migrate to muscles, where they encyst, causing myalgia (parenteral phase).

OPTION d is Incorrect . Toxocara canis ( dog roundworm ) and Echinococcus granulosus (hydatid tapeworm ) are two parasites that can be acquired by ingestion of eggs from the feces of an infected dog. Echinococcosis is classically a condition of the lungs and liver and presents with single or multiple hepatic hydatid cysts, which may lead to liver enlargement. Symptoms of toxocariasis include weight loss and hepatomegaly . However, the stool culture findings seen in this patient are not consistent with either of these pathogens and exposure to dog feces is not associated with schistosomiasis . OPTION e is Correct . Freshwater snails in endemic regions (including most parts of Africa) serve as the intermediate host for schistosomiasis . Parasitic larvae ( cercariae ) initially penetrate the skin and enter the circulation to mature, and eventually produce eggs that migrate through the venous system and can spread to the lungs , spleen , liver , and brain. Hepatosplenic involvement is commonly seen with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum infection, while chronic infection with Schistosoma haematobium classically leads to epithelial metaplasia and squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder ."
